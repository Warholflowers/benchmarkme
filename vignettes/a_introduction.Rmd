```



## Overview 

A straightforward way of speeding up your analysis, is to buy a better computer. Modern desktops are relatively cheap, especially compared to user time. However, it isn't clear clear if upgrading your computing is worth the cost. `benchmarkme` provides a set of benchmarks to help quantify your system. More importantly, it allows you to compare your timings with other systems.

## Getting Started

To benchmark your system just run

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library("benchmarkme")
res = benchmark_std(runs = 3)
```

The `runs` argument controls the number of replicates. If you have a fast system, then consider increasing this number. Currently it takes around a minute to run a single benchmark on a standard system (so $3$ minutes for $3$ runs).

You can upload the results using

```{r eval=FALSE}
id = upload_results(res)
```

The object `id` contains a unique identifier that you can use to extract your
dataset in future versions of the package.

## Exploring the Results

Past results are included in a companion package and can be accessed via

```{r}
data(past_results, package="benchmarkmeData")
```

The data set is a simple data frame

```{r}
head(past_results, 3)
```

and can plotted via

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5}
plot_past()
## shine() # if you have shiny
```

You can also see how you computer measures up with others

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5}
plot(res)
## shine(res) # if you have shiny
```

## Interactive Tables

If you crave raw numbers, install the `DT` package` 

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("DT")
```

and run 

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Your result is highlighted in orange.
get_datatable(res)
get_datatable_past()
```
